Coverletter
Hello! My name is Eduardo Kokubo. I am a brazilian man living in Japan since 2016. I came here with my wife in order to save money to pay for a college in Canada. I started working as a Machine Operator in Sharp Co., despite my academic background as Bachelor of Music, then a post graduation in Cinema Production. In Brazil, I have worked as Video Editor, Cinematographer, Director, Camera Operator and Script Writer. In Japan, as I have already mentioned, I have worked as Machine Operator, Material Handler, and nowadays Truck Driver. Studying Software Development is an old dream since I was a teenager realizing me as a Game Developer. Well, time passed, and now, with more then 40 years old, I finally started a Web Development Bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu at Udemy. Before this program, I have concluded Programming Logic and Algorithms taught by Dr. Nelio Alves at Udemy as well, and Cibersecurity Fundamentals at SENAI Online. I have some interest for Cybersecurity and Artificial Inteligence, so I can turn this way on the future.
